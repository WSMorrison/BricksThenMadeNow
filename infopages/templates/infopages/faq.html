                        <h3>About Bricks Then Made Now</h3>
                        <p>Bricks Then Made Now is a place for Adult Followers of Lego to find some of their favorite vintage sets made in the modern, playset Lego style.</p>
                        <p>For a lot of us, playing with Lego in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s are a source of great memories. Even though creative play is the cornerstone of playing with Lego, there are certain sets that are iconic and will always be a part of our Lego experience. BTMN does our best to recreate these sets, carrying through the colorways and often specific printed elements to connect the modern builds to the vintage designs that inspired them.</p>
                        <p>The BTMN sets are not official Lego sets, and we are not affiliated with Lego. However, we have every intention to recreate Lego’s renowned playability. The modern sets are designed, built with real bricks, and designed again until the set is stable and strong enough for kids. These are toys after all, even our AFOL focus doesn’t give us an excuse to design sets that won’t stand up to vigorous play. The sets aren’t “built fragile,” as many AFOL creations are. The Lego instructions are clear and while the building techniques are modern and sometimes even complex, the sets are all intentionally similar what to what comes in those famous yellow boxes.</p>
                        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                        <h4>What’s the difference between the Instructions, the ModernSet, and the VintageSet?</h4>
                        <p>The Instructions are just that, a digital instructions download. They will be available immediately after your purchase is successful! The ModernSet includes the immediate instructions download, but we will also ship you all the bricks to build it! If your nostalgia is running high, then the VintageSet is for you! Not only will you get the instructions you can download immediately and all the bricks to build the modern version, but you’ll also get all the vintage bricks you’ll need to build the kit from decades ago! </p>
                        <h4>Do the vintage sets use vintage bricks?</h4>
                        <p>Every effort is made to get full vintage Lego sets including the appropriate colors as well as the correct element variant. If the original set used Light Gray instead of Light Blueish Gray, the correct color will be used. If the jumper is the old style without the groove – the jumper in your set won’t have a groove either and we’ll send condolences to your fingernails.</p>
                        <h4>Do the modern sets use genuine Lego bricks? </h4>
                        <p>BTMN uses only official, real Lego. We do not modify parts, even printed parts, and therefore don’t use bricks in colors that are not available from Lego. If we can update and improve a colorway when Lego releases elements in new colors – we will!</p>
                        <h4>If I want the vintage Lego set, and enough bricks to build two of the BTMN version, what do I do?</h4>
                        <p>The VintageSet includes a ModernSet, so you can get one VintageSet, and one ModernSet. No need to buy a third package! And no matter what you buy, you’ll get the instructions for an immediate download</p>
